# Google Summer of Code

This Git repository stores information about Open2C's participation in Google Summer of Code. It is based off the [NumFOCUS GSoC materials](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc).

Four of Open2C's libraries are NumFOCUS affiliated projects: [cooler](https://github.com/open2c/cooler), [cooltools](https://github.com/open2c/cooltools), [pairtools](https://github.com/open2c/pairtools), and [bioframe](https://github.com/open2c/bioframe).

Note that while NumFOCUS serves as a GSOC umbrella mentor organization most years, this year Open2C is operating as a separate GSoC mentor organization, which means that any Open2C project, including those beyond the four above are eligible for GSoC projects! You can take a look at all projects in our GitHub organization [profile](https://github.com/open2c/).

        <h1>Open2C</h1>
        <p>
          <a href="https://open2c.github.io/">Open2C</a> is a community that develops and maintains open-source tools for 3D chromosome biology and genomic data science, primarily in Python. Most of the tools are focused on the analysis of data obtained using Hi-C and related technologies. We like our tools to be easy to use, flexible, to facilitate active development of novel analytical approaches, and scalable, to make use of the latest and largest datasets.
