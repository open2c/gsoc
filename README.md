        <p>
          <a href="https://open2c.github.io/">Open2C</a> is a community that develops and maintains open-source tools for 3D chromosome biology and genomic data science, primarily in Python. Most of the tools are focused on the analysis of data obtained using Hi-C and related technologies. We like our tools to be easy to use, flexible, to facilitate active development of novel analytical approaches, and scalable, to make use of the latest and largest datasets.
